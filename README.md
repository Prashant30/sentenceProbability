# sentenceProbability
I was just playing around with basics of NLP and built a bigram model to find a probability of a sentence. The model was built on a corpus of sentences. In this repository, I used both with laplace smoothing and without laplace smoothing.

Steps to build/compile and run:

1) Change the path of the corpus file accordingly and give the correct path/location of the corpus file.
2) Give a correct english sentence to check the probablity of that sentence.
